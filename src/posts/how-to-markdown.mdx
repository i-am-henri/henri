Markdown is a really powerfull technology, it's a great data-format for docs. In this article, I go through how to implement 
this  technology in your apps, easily and fast. This is a simple guide for [nextjs](https://nextjs.org).

For my blog, I wanted a fast solution which should be fast to load, cheap to run and easy to implement. A week ago, I stumbled
across a new library called "content-collections". The name is a little bit confusing, because [Astro](https://astro.build) also has
a package, which is called content-collections. This library loads your content, validats it and returns an error, which you can 
work with. This project also has a package to render Markdown, which is working like [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote).

<Highlight code={`function wow() {
    cool()
    henri.isCool()
    if (wow === cool) {
        const hallo = new Reader()
    }
    return (
    <div className="hoo">
        <p>
    </div>
    )
}`} />
