# The problem
All this begann with the big question: Which f*cking framework should I use for my nextjs application? [Nextra]()? [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app)? Or even a new player like [mdxts](https://mdxts.dev)? So I choose mdxts, a fast and new library, what should go wrong? And that was first problem. The library wasn't made for windows, after a day of trying, I realized that I should use another provider. Fumadocs now. The same goes. An error which wasn't documentet and days of searching in the node_modules folder.
